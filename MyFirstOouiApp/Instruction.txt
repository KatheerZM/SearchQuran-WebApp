Welcome to the Quran Search. These are some instructions for use.

In essence, the search engine is in Arabic. It only searches the Arabic text of the Quran. However, there is a built in English-letters-to-Arabic converter for ease of use. It is NOT a translation, only a type of transliteration from e.g. 'b' to ب.

# Conversion #
Some simple examples of the letter conversion are "kitaab" to كِتَاب and "raiba" to رَيْبَ. A list of the non-obvious conversions is given below:
- The word "Allah" converts to the word اللَّه, and lillah is لِلَّه
- al- is a quick الْ, as in al-qamar (الْقَمَر)
- th becomes ث
- H becomes ح, and h becomes ه
- kh becomes خ
- z becomes ذ, and Z becomes ز
- s becomes س, and S becomes ص
- dh becomes ض
- T becomes ط
- zh becomes ظ
- ' becomes ع
- gh becomes غ
- q becomes ق
- v or w for و
- N and n both usually become ن, but sometimes n might be confused with tanween.
- Capital vowels can be used for any type of hamza like أ or ء or ئ or ؤ. The search engine treats all hamzas the same. Depending on the diacritic on it, the letters A, I, and O can be used. For elongation, Aa, Ee, and Oo. For tanween, An, In, and so on.
- For a hamza alone without diacritics, a lone e can be used.

The rest of the letters correspond to their obvious letter in lower case. For example, r becomes ر. For shaddah, repeat the letter twice.

For diacritics (fathah, dhammah, zabar, pesh, etc.):
- a for fathah, and aa for fathah with an ا after it. Note that the ى like in مُوسَى is treated the same as an ا since they act the same. So, to search for مُوسَى, you can type moosaa.
- i for kasrah, and ee for kasrah with a ي after it
- u or o for dhammah, and oo for dhammah with a و after it
- . is sukoon. Don't forget the sukoon! The search muslimoon will give no results, but mus.limoon will give results.
- For a hamza with a sukoon on it, a sukoon can be added in front of the above diacritics. For example, ba.san gives بَأْسً.
- ai and ao can also be used
- For tanween: an, in, and on can be used

# Features #
- You can search phrases by using spaces in between. For example, laa raiba (لَا رَيْبَ) can searched for.
- You can search for verses that include two different words/phrases without any specific order using &. For example, laa raiba & mottaqeen (لَا رَيْبَ & مُتَّقِين). This search will give all verses that both include the phrase لَا رَيْبَ and also include (not necessarily after or before) مُتَّقِين.
- You can make multiple searches using ;. For example, if you search "laa raiba & mottaqeen; haaroon", you will both get the aforementioned verses of laa raiba & mottaqeen but also any verses that include haaroon
- You can quickly write multiple searches using [A,B,C, etc]. This is when you have multiple options of what can be in a specific place. For example, if you wanted to search for both rabba and rabbo, you can write it as rabb[a,o]. The brackets don't necessarily need to be at the end. You can have multiple options in the middle of a word.
- You can use the root of a word to search instead of the word itself using commas: A,B,C. Knowing that the root of mottaqeen is وقي, you can search for all words with that root using v,q,y.
- All the above features are intercombinable!
